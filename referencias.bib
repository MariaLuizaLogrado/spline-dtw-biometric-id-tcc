The development portion is made available to researchers, and the sequestered portion is reserved for testing facerecognition algorithms. The FERET evaluation procedure is an independently administered test of face-recognition algorithms. The test was designed to: (1) allow a direct comparison between different algorithms, (2) identify the most promising approaches, (3) assess the state of the art in face recognition, (4) identify future directions of research, and (5) advance the state of the art in face recognition.}

This chapter discusses a general class of splines having some useful characteristics for design purposes. Some known splines are special cases of these splines. Of particular interest, however, is the subclass of these splines, which is local and interpolating. The chapter discusses the following parameters for blending polynomials to demonstrate a class of splines: differentiability, degree of polynomials to be blended , the localness of the spline, which determines whether it interpolates or approximates, and the type of blending function. By taking the Cartesian cross product of two splines, one can get a bivariate surface that interpolates a grid of points.}
